Overview of Internet Technologies
In this lecture we will learn how internet technologies work primary the frontend and the backend
the frontend and backend together forms a web application
the frontend part contains how a website should look like, how the website should interact and behave
the backend connects to the database and keep records of the website with all the information about the site
the system is connected to the frontend server which is then connected to the backend sserver and then the backend server and the database are connected internally
both the frontend and backend needs to work together, failure of one may result in failure of the entire website
in this course all the frontend part will be written with React, the backend part with Node + express and the database with MongoDB
when we use some website the DNS in our area identifies that which domain name is connected to which Ip Address, 
after finding the address of the frontend server it makes the request to the ip address and then the information between the server and the system will be transferred with the help of OSI layer
in a web application there can be multiple backend servers doing different jobs
similarly there can be multiple database servers doing different jobs
